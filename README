This directory will hold community-contributed plugins or hooks for AII.

When adding new code to the contrib area, create a new directory under
plugins or hooks, and add the code there. Do not forget to add a description
of the new plugin and add a file MAINTAINER.

The contents of the contrib hierarchy are not part of standard AII and
are not officially supported by the AII maintainers.
