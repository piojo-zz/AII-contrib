Trivial AII hook for initializing the use of certificates within
CCM. I'll add the documentation some day. The code of the certificate
packages can be found at 
https://heppc1.ft.uam.es/svn/Quattor_Dev/UAM/

(files ca_windows.pl, node_cert_ca.pl, openssl.conf,
node_cert_gen.sh).

Documentation to be improved.
